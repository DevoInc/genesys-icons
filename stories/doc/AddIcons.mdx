# Adding new icons

To add new icons you should design a new icon following the conventions of
Devo and follow the next steps.

## Icon naming

The icon file should be named using only lower case characters, numbers (but not
at the beginning) and underscore.

- Right example could be: 'simple_icon', 'number_13', ...
- Wrong example could be: 'SimpleIcon', '13_number', 'other characters: ?/*&'...

## Adding to the icons folder

At the root of the project you will find an `icons` folder.

In this directory you can find all the files with the _svg_ extension from which
the icons are generated.

To add a new icon just add the new _svg_ file.
It is important that this file contains the `<title>` and `<desc>` tags.
This is mandatory.

In the `<title>` tag, indicate the name of the icon, and in the `<desc>` tag,
indicate the labels, separated by commas, related to the icon.

Let's see an example:

```
<svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 32">
  <title>bubble_chart</title>
  <desc>chart,bubble</desc>
  <path d="M14.085 9.048c0 2.211-1.793 4.004-4.004 4.004s-4.004-1.793-4.004-4.004c0-2.211 1.793-4.004 4.004-4.004s4.004 1.793 4.004 4.004z"></path>
</svg>
```

The name for the new icon will be the `GI` prefix and the `<title>` tag
content, converted to the camelCase format.

Following the previous example, the name for the icon will be _GIBubbleChart_.

## Generate all the packages icons

After adding the icon to the icons folder, you will need to generate the
new output with the changes. Follow the steps [here](TODO).
